# AUR build artifacts
*.pkg.tar.zst
*.pkg.tar.xz
pkg/
# Note: AUR creates a src/ directory during build, but we need to track our actual src/ code
# So we'll ignore AUR src files specifically, not the entire src/ directory
# /src/ would ignore root-level src during AUR build (but we need to track it)
# Instead, ignore common AUR src patterns:
*.src.tar.gz
.SRCINFO
